# Implementation of Exercise 2

Please refer to the branch `exercise-02-starter` for the implementation details of Exercise 2.

**Note on Integration:**
There were challenges encountered while attempting to merge the `exercise-02-starter` branch with the `main` branch. An approach was taken to manually copy the code from the `exercise-02-starter` branch to the `main` branch, which may have impacted the functionality. The integrity of the `main` branch is presently uncertain, though the `exercise-02-starter` branch is confirmed to be stable and functioning as expected.

For contributors and users, it is recommended to review the `exercise-02-starter` branch for the most reliable version of the implemented exercise. Further efforts will be made to resolve the merging issues and ensure the `main` branch reflects the latest, stable codebase.

This version maintains a formal tone, clearly communicates the current status, and guides the reader on where to find the stable version of the code.
